# Buffer Overflow 2
Please proceed to the `runshell` folder.

You will be exploiting the buffer overflow vulnerability to get the shell with a higher privilege.

Your job is to provide malicious input to the program `launcher`. Once you run it, the program will wait for your input. It's the same program that we talked about in the lecture. Please refer to the pointer addresses printed out to the screen to exploit the buffer overflow. If you successfully override the address, you will have a shell with `ctf-bof` privilege. You can then print out the flag by running `cat flag`.

Good luck.
